- Identify key **stakeholders** and beneficiaries, describing each role and their needs.
- Clarify the project's core **value proposition** and high-level goals.
- List major **use cases** or user stories (e.g., "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]").
- Use **Gherkin syntax** (`Scenario:`, `Given/When/Then`) for functional requirements to ensure clarity and stakeholder understanding.
- Write Gherkin scenarios in plain language so both technical and non-technical stakeholders can follow the behavior specification.

# n8n-workflow-all-templates Stakeholders

## Value Proposition

Provide the most comprehensive collection of n8n workflow templates (7400+), with two ways to discover and use them: static Browse (tags, download) and Supabase-backed Templates (search, node-type filters, workflow preview).

## Stakeholders

### 1. Template Consumers (n8n users)
- **Need**: Find and reuse n8n workflow templates for automation
- **Interest**: High – primary users
- **Use**: Browse by tags, search by text/node type, preview workflow, download JSON

### 2. Contributors
- **Need**: Maintain and grow the template collection
- **Interest**: Medium
- **Use**: Run scraper, enrich metadata, add templates to repo

### 3. Developers
- **Need**: Work on explorer or scraper effectively
- **Interest**: High
- **Use**: Build index, run dev server, run scraper, deploy to Vercel

## Use Cases

- **As a** template consumer, **I want** to filter templates by tags **so that** I can find workflows for specific integrations.
- **As a** template consumer, **I want** to search by text and node type **so that** I can find workflows using particular n8n nodes.
- **As a** template consumer, **I want** to view a workflow preview **so that** I understand the structure before importing.
- **As a** template consumer, **I want** to download JSON or ZIP **so that** I can import into n8n.
- **As a** developer, **I want** to run the scraper **so that** Supabase stays in sync with the template source.

## Gherkin Scenarios

### Browse Page
```
Scenario: Filter templates by tag
  Given I am on the Browse page
  When I select a tag from the filter
  Then I see only templates that have that tag
  And I can download individual JSON or full ZIP

Scenario: Sort templates
  Given I am on the Browse page
  When I choose a sort option (name, id, tags, popularity)
  Then the template list is reordered accordingly
```

### Templates Page (Supabase)
```
Scenario: Search templates by text
  Given I am on the Templates page
  When I enter search text
  Then I see templates matching the search
  And I can filter by node type

Scenario: View workflow preview
  Given I am on a template detail page
  When the page loads
  Then I see a React Flow visualization of the workflow
  And I can copy the JSON with one click
```

### Scraper
```
Scenario: Sync from n8n API
  Given the scraper has valid Supabase credentials
  When I run npm run scrape
  Then templates are fetched from api.n8n.io
  And uploaded to Supabase
```
